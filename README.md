## Data Modeling & Engineeing
- An [Entity Relationship Diagram *(ERD)*](/EmployeeSQL/ERD_QuickDBD.png) was created and saved as png.
- The ERD was also exported to PostgreSQL, and served as a basis for the [Table Schemata](/EmployeeSQL/schema.sql).
- **DROP TABLE** queries are provided at the top in ***reverse order***, as to ensure no data overlap.

## Data Analysis
- Each query is seperated by comments describing what it is fetching.
- The [Query File can be found here.](/EmployeeSQL/queries.sql)
